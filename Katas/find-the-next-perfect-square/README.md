## Description

You might know some pretty large perfect squares. But what about the NEXT one?

Complete the `findNextSquare` method that finds the next integral perfect square after the one passed as a parameter. Recall that an integral perfect square is an integer n such that sqrt(n) is also an integer.  

If the argument is itself not a perfect square then return either `-1` or an empty value like `None` or `null`, depending on your language. You may assume the argument is non-negative.

**Examples:(Input --> Output)**

```
121 --> 144
625 --> 676
114 --> -1 since 114 is not a perfect square
```
